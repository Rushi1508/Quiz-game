This is a simple Quiz game created using python.

There are series of multiple choice questions.

Select one option.

This code is for creating a simple quiz game using the tkinter library for graphical user interfaces (GUI) and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) for working with images. Let's break it down step by step:

1) Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries - tkinter for creating GUI elements and PIL for working with images.

2) Defining the QuizGame Class: The code defines a class named QuizGame that inherits from the tk.Tk class. This means it's creating a window-based application using the tkinter library.

3) Initializing the Game: Inside the __init__ method of the QuizGame class, the window's title and dimensions are set. It also initializes some variables, like the current question number and the player's score. Then, it calls the create_welcome_screen method to set up the initial welcome screen.

4) Creating the Welcome Screen: The create_welcome_screen method sets up the welcome screen UI. It creates labels to display welcome messages and rules of the quiz, as well as a "Start Quiz" button. The button is linked to the start_quiz method.

5) Starting the Quiz: When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the start_quiz method is executed. This method sets up the quiz questions and answers in a list of dictionaries. It then calls the create_widgets method to set up the quiz UI and starts showing questions using the show_question method.

6) Creating UI Widgets: The create_widgets method sets up the UI elements for displaying quiz questions, options, and feedback. It creates labels for question numbers and text, option buttons for multiple-choice answers, and a feedback label to display if an answer was correct. It also defines methods for handling option selection and finishing the quiz.

7) Displaying Questions: The show_question method updates the UI with the current question's text and answer options. It also checks if all questions have been answered, and if so, it shows the results.

8) Selecting an Option: When an option button is clicked, the select_option method is called. It checks if the selected option matches the correct answer and updates the score. It then moves to the next question or shows the results if all questions are answered.

9) Showing Results: When all questions are answered, the show_results method displays the final score and a message indicating the quiz is completed. It removes unnecessary UI elements like option buttons and question numbers.
